Recently at my job I've updated the pagination components so that pressing number key while pagination buttons are in focus, it will move focus to the pagination input and immediately put in the number you've pressed. was it hard to do? no, it was like 15 lines of code at best. yet I wasn't the first person to work on this component who thought it something that should have been done.\n2) if all of that is easy (a clerk integration as you say) - then what's the conclusion? web dev is easy? so what should you do if you wanna be a frontend web dev? make a video game? great advice.\n\nas for Prime's understanding of frontend - I know you did React at Netflix and you even made some optimizations to react internals. Yet when Ryan Florence gave a you a challenge to implement his Remix newsletter with HTMx - what you've presented to him was a a form with 1 input which woulf after submission either display 1 error or redirect you to to a success page. And then Ryan listed a bunch of things you didnt implement. If that's supposed to be impressive, I'm not surprised you think of webdev this way.",

I agree exactly that when you're mouse clicking in a UI on a button, you should be able to drag off before releasing to cancel. But if you're using a key press to do an attack in a game, then it 100% should be \"on press\" not \"on release\" (I'm aware some games actually make this a user option for quick-casting where \"while you hold it\" it shows you an aiming indicator, and that's fine too, as long as it's optional especially) -- but in general, like jumping or sliding in a game should be something that happens on press, as it makes the game feel snappier to the user's input.",

I was so focused on getting the underlying systems to work that I paid no attention to making an experience that would be _fun_ or _enjoyable._ I didn't prototype any proper enemy layouts, weapon loadouts, bullet sprays to navigate (for those who like those sorts of bullet-hell games), things like that. Over time, I learned that things like that should still be present in spec and focus even if the immediate task is not necessarily directly relevant. While I consider myself artistically inclined, I simply didn't put in the effort needed to make more than one player ship, one test enemy ship, a smattering of particle graphics, and some placeholder backgrounds and text graphics.\n\nMark Brown at Game Maker's Toolkit has an ongoing series of videos describing the making of his indie game \"Mind Over Magnet\" where he goes over not just the process of making and troubleshooting the systems, but also making and troubleshooting the levels, assets, and even the processes themselves. Even if one might not agree 100% with his specific philosophy or praxis (he _is_ using a Unity-based workflow, after all), he has shown himself to be a guy who puts his money where his mouth is in his dev efforts after building his channel making videos for years analyzing what makes games tick.",
