Recently at my job I've updated the pagination components so that pressing number key while pagination buttons are in focus, it will move focus to the pagination input and immediately put in the number you've pressed. was it hard to do? no, it was like 15 lines of code at best. yet I wasn't the first person to work on this component who thought it something that should have been done.\n2) if all of that is easy (a clerk integration as you say) - then what's the conclusion? web dev is easy? so what should you do if you wanna be a frontend web dev? make a video game? great advice.\n\nas for Prime's understanding of frontend - I know you did React at Netflix and you even made some optimizations to react internals. Yet when Ryan Florence gave a you a challenge to implement his Remix newsletter with HTMx - what you've presented to him was a a form with 1 input which woulf after submission either display 1 error or redirect you to to a success page. And then Ryan listed a bunch of things you didnt implement. If that's supposed to be impressive, I'm not surprised you think of webdev this way.",

I agree exactly that when you're mouse clicking in a UI on a button, you should be able to drag off before releasing to cancel. But if you're using a key press to do an attack in a game, then it 100% should be \"on press\" not \"on release\" (I'm aware some games actually make this a user option for quick-casting where \"while you hold it\" it shows you an aiming indicator, and that's fine too, as long as it's optional especially) -- but in general, like jumping or sliding in a game should be something that happens on press, as it makes the game feel snappier to the user's input.",

I was so focused on getting the underlying systems to work that I paid no attention to making an experience that would be _fun_ or _enjoyable._ I didn't prototype any proper enemy layouts, weapon loadouts, bullet sprays to navigate (for those who like those sorts of bullet-hell games), things like that. Over time, I learned that things like that should still be present in spec and focus even if the immediate task is not necessarily directly relevant. While I consider myself artistically inclined, I simply didn't put in the effort needed to make more than one player ship, one test enemy ship, a smattering of particle graphics, and some placeholder backgrounds and text graphics.\n\nMark Brown at Game Maker's Toolkit has an ongoing series of videos describing the making of his indie game \"Mind Over Magnet\" where he goes over not just the process of making and troubleshooting the systems, but also making and troubleshooting the levels, assets, and even the processes themselves. Even if one might not agree 100% with his specific philosophy or praxis (he _is_ using a Unity-based workflow, after all), he has shown himself to be a guy who puts his money where his mouth is in his dev efforts after building his channel making videos for years analyzing what makes games tick.",

Ideally, the 4 variables you are left with is the 2 cutoff frequencies and the 2 slopes which you can calibrate to the latency the user has at any given time. Sometimes you end up with a single-liner.\n\nIf you can't be bothered, just lowpass it. That also works and it is definitely a single liner.\n\nIt did work wonders with a physics engine running at 10hz I was playing with 'bout 10 years ago.",

Wesnoth doesn't have that but it does have different types of tiles such as bushes and jungle that affect the units in different ways like reducing their range or movespeed. Shrinking arena could add an element of pressure or competition. Reminds me of how competitive things like fortnite or pubg feel just because the arena shrinks.",

I planned to implement an enemy that had motion kind of similar to a \"Snatcher\" or \"Angry Trapper\" from the jungle biome in Terraria, where its motion has a random wobbling component. This implementation, with multiple sinewaves of random frequencies summed together and then pinched with a tapering function, is perfect. I'll probably implement some kind of \"Oscillation\" class which can handle a variable number of dimensions, durations and max amplitudes. It could be reused not only for game entity motion, but camera shakes and even potentially UI elements as well.\n\nI did not expect to have this kind of revelation when I clicked on this video.

I'm positive no recruiter ever clicked any of those links but to this day I get GitHub stars so that means I'm helping other devs and that makes me happy.\n\nMy first game I did during university. It got ported to Switch and almost won an award for best student game on a huge Latin American games festival. My second was just a bomberman clone with react and expressjs that I made after a bootcamp (I quit university at some point, was doing math not CS) and getting into web dev was better than getting into game dev.\n\nBut none of that mattered, I spent 5 months trying to get my first job. When I finally got it, it was because I got a referral from a friend from uni. We didn't talked too much about any of that during the interview, it was definitely the first interview I did with an actual tech person (founder of the company) and he said he would skip a technical test because I didn't sounded like I was bullshitting him plus he trusted my friend's judgement. I didn't got to show off any of that, I just told him I did. I'm sure I didn't needed all that crap to get hired though. That was all during May of last year.\n\nI know Prime means well but he definitely is out of touch with the current reality of job hunting. The hours I spent filling forms, doing tech tests and writing cover letters for job offerings that weren't even real was insane. Getting a better portfolio is not really gonna help you too much, I believe there's a minimum threshold and going past that is not optimal. Finding a real job offering before others is the real challenge, and that comes down to a bit of luck which translates into trying for enough time. Oh yeah, and when you finally get hired, expect a very low salary. Good luck with rent.",

A UI button you usually want to do the action on release so the user can do the very common action of moving their input off that button before release.  It also allows for visual feedback before committing since you animate it on press and release.  If you are manipulating a scroll view you do it during down.  But I know John is a performance absolutist so anything that adds in delay gets killed.  So the input delay on waiting for release would be one of those things.",

You need to identify what might need to be shared, what stays on the client, what stays on the server, what is in both but not synced, etc. Converting a single player game to multiplayer is insanely hard because no one thought about responsabilities and state. If you remember the entire way through that this is a multiplayer game, nothing stops you from making your first prototype single player and doing the server later. What matters is that when it comes to networking, your state is already ready to be networked, and your gameplay logic isn't tangled up.",

When I graduated from university, I submitted about 1000 resumes in half a year, and these were absolutely all open vacancies in the IT field in my region, i.e. not only vacancies for programmers, but also near-programmers, security specialists, etc. Out of a thousand resumes, I received about 5 interviews, two of them continued with tasks to solve, at the end of one of the tasks they told me that I was suitable, but they were waiting for the head of the department, then they would invite me to an interview with him, etc. and another time they supposedly hired me and the next day my employment was supposed to begin, but suddenly they wrote that they found someone else. Then for several more months I did nothing and slept all day long, since I could not find any work at all, and the money I earned on two commercial projects was already running out. I was desperate. In the end, after three interviews, one company hired me as a loader in a warehouse! A few months later, one of my friends hired me as a programmer in his department without any interviews. I worked there all the time until I left Russia. P.S. The hardest thing about being an ordinary programmer is to keep learning something new while your job is to move boxes or do something that is not related to learning something new in programming. Most of us never get a chance in this field, and doing this only for yourself all your life is very difficult or almost impossible.",
